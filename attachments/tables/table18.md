***Table 18: Abundances of classified species, Kraken2, Default Database.*** Kraken2 is able to assign the majority of reads. Over all four samples, an average of 9.87% of reads are unclassified, the PromethION samples showing a slightly increased rate of unclassified reads. With the CS Even samples, all ten species are identified. Considering the CS Log samples, *Listeria monocytogenes* is identified as a predominant species with 81.283% and 79.70% for GridIOnN and PromethION, respectively. The two other species with at least 1% abundance are *Bacillus subtilis* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. <br> <br>
