***Table 2: General Information about the Samples.***  This table shows different information about the four samples of this project, including quality and read length (N50) as well as information about the used terms. In general, the PromethION samples are sequenced with greater depth resulting in more than 34 million reads, whereas the GridION samples contain around 3.6 million reads. The quality of all samples ranges from 9.8 to 10.7. The N50 is 5.4 except for GridION364, where it is 5.3. The information are gathered from Nicholls et al. in 2019 [[14]](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz043 "Nicholls, S. M., Quick, J. C., Tang, S., & Loman, N. J. (2019). Ultra-deep, long-read nanopore sequencing of mock microbial community standards. *Gigascience*, 8(5), giz043.").<br> <br>
