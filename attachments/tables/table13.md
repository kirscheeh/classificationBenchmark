***Table 13: Abundances of classified species, Diamond, Default Database.*** The table shows the classification results of Diamond for the GridION considering the default database (in %). Diamond is not able to identify all bacterial species in the sample, but is able to identify *Listeria monocytogenes* as predominant species in the CS Log sample. The amount of reads not assigned to a species or a species with less than 1% or abundance is high with 75.606% and 69.076% for GridION364 and GridION366, respectively. <br> <br>
