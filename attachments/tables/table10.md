***Table 10: Overview of Time Consumption for the Default Runs.*** Time is given as hh:mm:ss and if needed, the number of days is stated explicitly in front. Cells with a dash symbolize runs that did not start or took unreasonable much time to start. The time benchmarks can be found in [here, Line 26](../paths.md "Benchmark Files, Default"). <br> <br>
