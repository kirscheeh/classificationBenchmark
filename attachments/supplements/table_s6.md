***Table-S6: Abundances of classified species, Kaiju, (custom).*** The table shows the classification results of Kaiju for all four samples considering the custom database (in %). Here, the fungal species are classified, but some bacterial species are missing: *Bacillus subtilis* (which was also missing in the classification wit the default database), *Salmonella enterica*, *Escherichia coli*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. In general, slightly less reads are unclassified, but a majority of could not be identifies on species level. The abundances of identified species are smaller.
