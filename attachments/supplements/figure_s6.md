Centrifuge is able to identify the majority of the bacterial species correctly. Although the fungal species are included into the custom database, none are identified. Instead, Bacillus spizizenii is assigned 9.606% of reads, Salmonella enterica is not identified, but three currently unclassified Salmonella species and 14.671% od reads are classifies as Limosilactobacillus fermentum. The amount of reads assigned to something on another taxonomic rank has increased to 20.495%, whereas the percentage of unclassified reads decreased to 5.052%. This is also true for the absolute number of reads.|

Centrifuge is able to identify the majority of the bacterial species correctly. Although the fungal species are included into the custom database, none are identified. Instead, Bacillus spizizenii is assigned 9.169% of reads, Salmonella enterica is not identified, but three currently unclassified Salmonella species and 13.57% od reads are classifies as Limosilactobacillus fermentum. The amount of reads assigned to something on another taxonomic rank has increased to 23.762%, whereas the percentage of unclassified reads decreased to 5.493%.

In this sample, 6.582 of reads could not be classified at all and 11.971% of reads are assigned to taxa that are not on species level or the corresponding species has below 1% abundance. The remaining reads are assigned to *Listeria monocytogenes* (72.843%), *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (5.199%) and *Listeria innocua* (3.405%)|
