The most dominant species are Limosilactobacillus fermentum (13.963%) and Listeria monocytogenes (13.043%), but Staphylococcus aureus (10.633%), Bacillus spizizenii (10.531%) and Enterococcus faecalis (10.513%) follow with slightly less assigned reads. There are 9.56% of reads that could not be assigned at all and 8.289% are assigned to other taxonomic rank or species with less than 1% abundance. The bacterial species *Bacillus substilis*, *Salmonella enterica*, *Escherichia coli* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* range from 3.699% to 5.777%, whereas the two fungal species *Cryptococcus neoformans* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* have each around 2% of reads assigned (1.896% and 2.088%, respectively).|

The most dominant species are Limosilactobacillus fermentum (13.32%) and Listeria monocytogenes (12.626%), but Bacillus spizizenii (10.328%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.296%) and Enterococcus faecalis (10.231%) follow with slightly less assigned reads. There are 11.76% of reads that could not be assigned at all and 8.181% are assigned to other taxonomic rank or species with less than 1% abundance. The bacterial species *Bacillus substilis*, *Salmonella enterica*, *Escherichia coli* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* range from 3.718% to 5.793%, whereas the two fungal species *Cryptococcus neoformans* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* have each around 2% of reads assigned (1.852% and 2.012%, respectively). |

Kraken2 is able to assign the majoity of reads to *Listeria monocytogenes* with 81.607%. 4.523% are assigned to *Pseudomonas aeruginosas* and 8.74% of reads are not classified at all. The percentage of reads that are classified to a taxon not on species level or a species with less than 1% abundance is 5.13%. In contrast to the default database, *Bacillus subtilis* has a lower abundance than 1%.|

Kraken2 is able to assign the majoity of reads to *Listeria monocytogenes* with 80.044%. 4.469% are assigned to *Pseudomonas aeruginosas* and 10.57% of reads are not classified at all. The percentage of reads that are classified to a taxon not on species level or a species with less than 1% abundance is 4.917%. In contrast to the default database, *Bacillus subtilis* has a lower abundance than 1%. |
