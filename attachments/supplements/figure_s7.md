Although the majority of bacterial species of the sample are identified with the exception of *Bacillus subtilis* and *Listeria monocytogenes*, the classifiation result varies from the outcome using the default database. There are various new species with abundances ranging from 1.578% to 14.867%. The latter percentage of reads is assigned to *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum* which is previously known as *Lactobacillus plantarum*, which could explain the number of reads assigned to it, since *Lactobacillus fermentum* is a species in the dataset. Other species, however, do not have a connection to species of the dataset like *Thermoascus verrucosus*, which is a fungus, or *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. The fungal species of the dataset, however, are not identified with more than 1% of reads. In general, 14.407% of the reads are unclassified, whereas 15.863% of the reads are assigned to species that did not reach the 1% abundance or to other taxonomic rank.|

Although the majority of bacterial species of the sample are identified with the exception of *Bacillus subtilis* and *Listeria monocytogenes*, the classifiation result varies from the outcome using the default database. There are various new species with abundances ranging from 1.542% to 14.156%. The latter percentage of reads is assigned to *Lactiplantibacillus plantarum* which is previously known as *Lactobacillus plantarum*, which could explain the number of reads assigned to it, since *Lactobacillus fermentum* is a species in the dataset. Other species, however, do not have a connection to species of the dataset like *Thermoascus verrucosus*, which is a fungus, or *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. The fungal species of the dataset, however, are not identified with more than 1% of reads. In general, 15.119% of the reads are unclassified, whereas 16.588% of the reads are assigned to species that did not reach the 1% abundance or to other taxonomic rank.|

The classification results of this sample vary a lot from those using the default database. Instead of a predominant assignment to *Listeria monocytogenes* (which still has a fifth of reads assigned to), there are several species with small amounts of reads ranging between 1.094% to 6.252% including *Escherichia coli*, *Salmonella enterica* and *Staphylococcus aureus*, but also species like *Klebsiella penumoniae* and *Kocuria rhizophila*, which do not belong to the species of the dataset. In general, 20.861% of the reads are unclassified, whereas 23.16% of the reads are assigned to species that did not reach the 1% abundance or to other taxonomic rank.|

The classification results of this sample vary a lot from those using the default database. Instead of a predominant assignment to *Listeria monocytogenes* (which still has a fifth of reads assigned to), there are several species with small amounts of reads ranging between 1.062% to 5.925% including *Escherichia coli*, *Salmonella enterica* and *Staphylococcus aureus*, but also species like *Klebsiella penumoniae* and *Kocuria rhizophila*, which do not belong to the species of the dataset. In general, 19.612% of the reads are unclassified, whereas 23.793% of the reads are assigned to species that did not reach the 1% abundance or to other taxonomic rank.|
