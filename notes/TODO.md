# TODO LIST
- create a structure so that all is reproducible
- script for seed length
- protocol

- more information on benchmarking
  - leave one taxa out approach aka clade exclusion
  - existing benchmarking datasets
  - --> they did three things: clade exclusion, high-complexity fold standard CAMI assembly and recently publisehd sequences

# Tools that did not work
## Lime
- Installation via git and make commands
- Error in Install_Preprocessing_Tools.sh due to denied permission
- tried to do it manually: egsa make did throw a error
<!--
git clone https://github.com/veronicaguerrini/LiME	
cd LiME	
one of the follwing two make thingys; they are for different approaches
make chose this one
make EBWT=0	
Install_Preprocessing_Tools.sh ging nicht (permission denied). Habs hÃ¤ndisch versucht, Fehler bei egsa make; dont know why
-->
## Megan-LR
- page for this tool could not be found?!

## MetaMaps
- Installation instructions are bad
- conda: dependeny cpp-boost needed in correct version --> throw a lot of incompatabilities
